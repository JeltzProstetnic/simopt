removed all unknown using directives
changed all implementations of DefaultObject to SimpleEntity or StochasticEntity for cases which have their own Random<T> instances
changed all implementations of IObject to IEntity
changed ConsoleRedirector to RichTextBoxConsoleRedirector (TODO: change all Console.Write* to logging)
removed all DefaultModel.ResetAutoSeeds() calls
changed all DefaultEvent occurrences to BinaryEvent
changed all NegExponential and Tirangular to NegExponentialDistribution and TriangularDistribution and changed ParametrizeMean calls to ConfigureMean
Changed all Random types to Random<double> or Random<int>
Changed all NextDouble calls on Random<T> to Next
changed all entity ctors to take an IModel as parameter to be able to pass it on to the base ctor
added Name property to Patient (was changed from DefaultObject which had a Name to SimpleEntity which doesn't)
Added datetime<=>double conversions due to the new model class being based on double as time type
removed all Model.AddObject calls
added a Model property to the Siumlation class and created an instance in the Simulation ctor
moved OnBuildModel logic to Simulation ctor and removed method
removed all Simulation.BuildModel calls
changed Model.GetFirstObjectOfType<T>() calls to Model.FindEntities<T>().First()
moved OnModelInitialized code in PatientSource and TreatmentPoint to ctors (via new Initialize() methods) because they created a distribution based on ctor params which are not available during base call

works :-)
